OVER-VIEW OF THE PROJECT :-

This code defines a basic personal portfolio website using HTML. Let's break down the code section by section:

1. DOCTYPE and HTML declaration:
      DOCTYPE: This line specifies the document type as HTML.
      <html> tag: This is the root element of the HTML document and contains all other elements.
      lang="en": This attribute defines the document's language as English.

2. Head Section:
      <head> tag: This section contains meta information about the document that is not displayed on the webpage itself.
      <meta charset="UTF-8">: This specifies the character encoding as UTF-8, allowing for proper display of various characters.
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This ensures the webpage responds to different screen sizes and adjusts the scale accordingly for optimal viewing on various devices.
      <title>Personal Portfolio</title>: This sets the title of the webpage, which is displayed on the browser tab.
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">: This line links an external CSS stylesheet file named "styles.css" to define the website's styling.

3. Body Section:
      <body> tag: This section contains the content that is displayed on the webpage.
      
      Navigation Bar (<nav>)
      This section creates a navigation menu using an unordered list (<ul>).
      Each list item (<li>) contains a link (<a>) to different sections within the webpage identified by their IDs (e.g., "#about", "#skills").
      There's also a link to a separate "resume.pdf" file that opens in a new tab (`target="_
      This section creates a contact section with an email address. Here's how it works:
      
      <section id="contact">: This creates a section element with an ID "contact" for styling purposes (using CSS).
      <h2>Contact</h2>: This defines a heading "Contact" within the section.
      <p>Email: ... </p>: This paragraph displays the text "Email:" followed by a link.
      <a href="mailto:parul62sharma@gmail.com">parul62sharma@gmail.com</a>: This creates a link element (<a>).
      href="mailto:parul62sharma@gmail.com": This attribute specifies the email address "parul62sharma@gmail.com" as the destination of the link.
      The text content "parul62sharma@gmail.com" is displayed as the clickable link.
      When a user clicks on this link, their email client (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) will open a new message window pre-filled with the recipient's email address. This allows users to easily contact the website owner 
      through email.
